# Warby-Parker-SQL-Usage-Funnel-Project

In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. The funnels and tables were provided by Codecademy, but the results and conclusions were reached independently. The tables include the following and are additionally described in this repository's PowerPoint.

Quiz Funnel: -survey
Home Try-On Funnel: -quiz -home_try_on -purchase

This project was a collaboration between Codecademy and Warby Parker’s Data Science team. It uses fictional data.

My findings are presented in the Powerpoint file. It contains additional information about the project, a summary of my results and snippets of the code used to find the results. The data was located in SQL tables and all analyzation was completed using SQL.
